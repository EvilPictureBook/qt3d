	adding:
		include (openvr/openvr.pri)
	ignoring:
		include (graphicshelpers/graphicshelpers.pri)

		also ignoring the mingw thing

handle_types_p.h:
	adding:

	ignoring:
		class QMatrix4x4; - assuming this is included in the new Qt3DCore stuff,
		may need to change QMatrix4v4 --> Matrix4x4
	changes:
		<OpenVRDevice, 16>HOpenVRDevice --> <OpenVRDevice> --- make sure this is correct

managers_p.h:
	changes:
		THIS WILL PROBABLY MEAN CHANGES TO OpenVRDeviceManager elsewhere !!!
		--> look at QResourceManager type . . .does it need an ArrayAllocationgPolicy?
		--> will have to look at the allocation policy, but I think that's handled internally now
		class OpenVRDeviceManager : public Qt3DCore::QResourceManager<
			OpenVRDevice,
			Qt3DCore::QNodeId,
			16, <----------------------------------- removed
			Qt3DCore::ArrayAllocatingPolicy> <------ removed
		{
		public:
		    OpenVRDeviceManager() {}
		};

	there could be something under the OpenVRSubmit:{ case...


renderer.cpp:
	- keeping m_submissionContext(nullptr) --> it seemsm to have replaced m_graphicsContext
	- disregarding m_changeSet(0) --> this is now m_dirtyBits.marked
	- discarding m_shaderGatherJob <-- seems to be from an older version of this
	- disregarding m_calculateBoundingVolumeJob
	- disregard m_sendBufferCaptureJob

	- double check that the VR stuff does not use depricated parts

renderer_p.h:
	- keeping new "class SubmissionContext"
	- discarding m_shaderGatherJob...
